# Bash Scripting LAB8

## Exercise

You want to monitor system resources (CPU, memory, and disk usage). Write a shell script that:
- Continuously monitors CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage.
- Sends an alert (prints a warning message and logs it) if:
    - CPU usage exceeds 80%.
    - Memory usage exceeds 90%.
    - Disk usage exceeds 85%.
- Runs the checks every 1 minute.
